# C-Adventure
Collection of challenges that I did when learning C

## Matrix Manipulation

Very simple challenge where I created an adaptive matrix and did a little bit of math with it

## Text Based Adeventure Game

Quite an undertaking for my beginner self. This took me WAY longer than Matrix Manipulation but I'm proud to say that I completed it.
