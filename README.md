# C-Adventure
Collection of challenges that I did when learning C

## Matrix Manipulation

Very simple challenge where I created an adaptive matrix and did a little bit of math with it

## Text Based Adeventure Game

Quite an undertaking for my beginner self. This took me WAY longer than Matrix Manipulation but I'm proud to say that I completed it.

NOTE: If you find any bugs with this project or any of the others, please notify me with an issue

## Palindromic Substrings

This one was quite hard for me. I was confused on how it worked logistically at first, but now I have a good understanding of it.
